# Simulation 1

The manipulator starts from the zero-configuration and performs a linear trajectory with the end-effector along the x-axis (i.e., it retreats). No singularity is encountered. The pseudo-inversion gives good results, therefore the DLS is expected to give similar results.

The error is zero (order of e-9):

and the joint velocities are small:
